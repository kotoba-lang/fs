  "Filesystem path ops + a host-injected IFilesystem protocol. Layer 3 (I/O) of
  the kotoba foundational stdlib.

  The path ops are pure (no OS). The effectful ops (read/write/list/exists?/
  delete) live behind the IFilesystem protocol, which a host implements and
  injects — a capability-confined kotoba cell only sees a granted handle, never
  the OS. An in-memory mem-filesystem is provided for tests / OSS standalone.

  Zero third-party runtime deps; .cljc (JVM / SCI / CLJS / GraalVM / kotoba-WASM)."
